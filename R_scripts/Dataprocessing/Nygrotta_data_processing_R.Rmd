##Let's take a look at the names of our column
names (taxo_raw)
##Now are our sequences all unique?
length (taxo_raw$sequence)
# 566
length (unique (taxo_raw$sequence))
#Same, great

#How about for our scientific names?
length ((taxo_raw$scientific_name))
#566, makes sense, same as our sequences. But how many of the scientific names are unique?
length (unique(taxo_raw$scientific_name))
#59. That's fine we'll agglomerate later
#Just to get an idea, how many sequences are per 
table (taxo_raw$scientific_name)
#Now we make sure every sequence is over 98% identity.

#Make sure that all taxa with a count under 200 has been removed by previous steps.
#Detect potential contaminants.
#For instance here we have the extraction blank AB022EB21b with 9347 reads assigned to Leuciscinae, a fish subfamily.
#None of our samples with Mamp007 have any reads assigned to this group, therefore it must be contaminant and will be removed.
#Once done we remove the blank.
#Remove the ReadSum column
#Set the sequences of fish and birds aside to add to the tables of Aves12S or Fish16S
#Save the new file as csv.
#NYMamp007_clean_AUGUST2023.csv

#Load your metadata
metadata <- Metadata_NYMamp007
#Make sure your metadata and your reads file have the same number of entry and that the sample names have the same in at least one field.
#Yes, it all has 47 observations

#I will want my data by sedimentary layer

#Reload your clean data
reads_layer <- NYMamp007_clean_AUGUST2023
#Make a matrix by layer
